# Etch-a-Sketch Solution - Odin Project

Welcome to the Etch-a-Sketch solution repository for The Odin Project's Etch-a-Sketch exercise. This repository contains a working implementation of the Etch-a-Sketch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below, you'll find an overview of the project's structure and how to use the solution. [Take a look.](https://selormdev.me/Etch-a-Sketch/)

## Project Overview

The Etch-a-Sketch exercise is designed to help learners practice and demonstrate their knowledge of web development technologies. This solution provides a fully functional Etch-a-Sketch web application that allows users to draw and erase on a grid, change grid size, select drawing colors, and clear the grid.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project structure:

- `index.html`: This HTML file contains the structure of the Etch-a-Sketch webpage, including the grid and controls.

- `styles.css`: The CSS file defines the styles and layout for the Etch-a-Sketch interface, ensuring an attractive and user-friendly design.

- `script.js`: The JavaScript file handles the functionality of the Etch-a-Sketch. It creates the grid, manages user interactions, and enables drawing and erasing.

## Project Requirements

- Create a grid of squares on the webpage.
- Implement the ability to draw on the grid using the mouse.
- Implement the ability to erase drawings on the grid.
- Add controls to allow users to change the grid size and select a drawing color.
- Implement a "Clear" button to reset the grid.
- Ensure that the grid remains responsive and adjusts to changes in size.
